                    <p>Recent advances in science and technology have made it possible for
                        geneticists to find out abnormalities in the unborn foetus and take remedial
                        action to rectify some defects which would otherwise prove to be fatal to
                        the child. Though genetic engineering is still at its infancy, scientists
                        can now predict with greater accuracy a genetic disorder. It is not yet an
                        exact science since they are not in a position to predict when exactly a
                        genetic disorder will set in. While they have not yet been able to change
                        the genetic order of the gene in germs, they are optimistic and are holding
                        out that in the near future they might be successful in achieving this feat.
                        They have, however, acquired the ability in manipulating tissue cells.
                        However, genetic misinformation can sometimes be damaging for it may
                        adversely affect people psychologically. Genetic information may lead to a
                        tendency to brand some people as inferiors. Genetic information can
                        therefore be abused and its application in deciding the sex of the foetus
                        and its subsequent abortion is now hotly debated on ethical lines. But on
                        this issue geneticists cannot be squarely blamed though this charge has
                        often been levelled at them. It is mainly a societal problem. At present
                        genetic engineering is a costly process of detecting disorders but
                        scientists hope to reduce the costs when technology becomes more advanced.
                        This is why much progress in this area has been possible in scientifically
                        advanced and rich countries like the USA, UK and Japan. It remains to be
                        seen if in the future this science will lead to the development of a race of
                        supermen or will be able to obliterate disease from this world.
