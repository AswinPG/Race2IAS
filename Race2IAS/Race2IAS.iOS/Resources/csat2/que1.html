                    <b>Directions: (1-8 ) Read the following passage carefully and answer the
                        questions given below</b>

                    <p>Govind’s father was a rich landlord, who was loved and respected by all his
                        tenants. When he died, he left large tracts of land to Govind. But Govind
                        did not spend a single day looking after his land. He had a funny idea, that
                        there existed a magic potion which, if it was poured on any object would
                        turn it into gold. He spent all his time trying to learn about this potion.
                        People took advantage of him and cheated him. His wife grew anxious. Given
                        the amount of money Govind was spending, she was sure that they would soon
                        be paupers.
                        One day, a widely respected sage who had been to the Himalayas came to their
                        town. Govind asked him about the potion. To his surprise the sage answered,
                        “I have learnt how to brew such a potion. But it is a difficult process.”
                        “Tell me!” insisted Govind, hardly able to believe his luck. “You have to
                        collect the dew which settles on the leaves of a banana tree every morning
                        during winter. There is a condition though. The tree should be planted and
                        watered regularly with your own hands. Store the collected dew in an earthen
                        vessel and when you have five litres, bring it to me. I will recite a sacred
                        mantra to transform the dew into the potion. A drop of the potion will be
                        sufficient to change any object into gold.”
                        Govind was worried. “Winter is only for a few months in the year. It will
                        take me years to collect the dew.” “You can plant as many trees as you
                        want,” replied the sage.,Govind went home and after talking to his wife,
                        began clearing the large fields which has been lying vacant for years. He
                        planted rows of banana saplings. He tended them with great care. His wife
                        helped him too. She would take the banana crop to market and get a good
                        price. Over the years the plantation grew and finally after six years Govind
                        had five litres of dew. He went to the sage who smiled, uttered a mantra and
                        sprinkled a few drops of dew on a copper vessel. To Govind’s dismay, nothing
                        happened. “You have cheated me!” he shouted at the sage.
                        The sage, however, smiled. Govind’s wife then came forward with a box. The
                        sage opened it and revealed stacks of gold coins inside. Turning to Govind
                        he said, “You worked hard on your land and created a plantation. Your wife
                        sold the produce in the market. It was your hard work which created this
                        wealth, not magic. If I had told you this earlier, you would not have
                        listened.” Govind understood the wisdom behind the sage’s words and worked
                        even harder from that day on.</p>
                    <span class="card-title">1. Why did Govind decide to cultivate a banana crop?</span>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <li>The soil of his land was suitable only for cultivating bananas.</li>
                        <li>It was the most highly priced commodity in the region.</li>
                        <li>It could be grown at any time of the year including winter</li>
                        <li>The ingredient for the magic potion could only be obtained from a banana
                            tree.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
